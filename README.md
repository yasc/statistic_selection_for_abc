## MSc Dissertation Code

This code accompanies the dissertation I wrote for completion of my master's degree at UCL. If you want to have a peek at the dissertation, then feel free to download the PDF version of it contained in this repository. The gist of the project was to compare the finite sample performance of a variety of statistic selection methods used for approximate Bayesian computation. The code uses Python's multiprocessing package to perform computations in parallel.
